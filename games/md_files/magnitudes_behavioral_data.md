# Magnitudes (Dots & Fractions) Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of trials
- Total correct responses
- Total incorrect responses
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Trial
- Trial index/order in session
- Stimulus type (dots or fractions)
- Number of items (dots) or values (fractions)
- Correct answer (ground truth)
- User’s selected answer
- Time stimulus appeared
- Time of user response
- Reaction time (ms)
- Whether response was correct or incorrect
- Number of attempts (if retries allowed)
- Type of error (e.g., overestimation, underestimation)
- Whether user skipped or timed out

### Per Response Action
- Response timestamp
- Answer selected
- Time since stimulus appeared
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before response (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Accuracy rate (overall, per stimulus type)
- Average reaction time (overall, per stimulus type)
- Error patterns (e.g., consistent over/underestimation)
- Change in accuracy/reaction time over session
- Consistency of response speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect response)
- Biases (e.g., tendency to favor certain answers)

### Other Contextual Data
- User’s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Approximate Number Sense (ANS) Acuity
- Numerical Reasoning
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Bias Awareness

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Number Sense Acuity (high vs. low)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Consistency vs. Variability
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Patience vs. Urgency
6. Confidence vs. Hesitation
7. Engagement vs. Distraction
8. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
9. Bias Awareness vs. Unawareness
10. Decision-Making Speed (deliberate vs. impulsive)
