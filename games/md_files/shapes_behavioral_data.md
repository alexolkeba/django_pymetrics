# Shapes Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of trials
- Total correct identifications
- Total incorrect identifications
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Trial
- Trial index/order in session
- Pattern/shape presented
- Correct answer (ground truth)
- User’s selected answer
- Time pattern appeared
- Time of user response
- Reaction time (ms)
- Whether response was correct or incorrect
- Number of attempts (if retries allowed)
- Type of error (e.g., missed embedded shape)
- Whether user skipped or timed out

### Per Response Action
- Response timestamp
- Answer selected
- Time since pattern appeared
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before response (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Accuracy rate (overall, per pattern type)
- Average reaction time (overall, per pattern type)
- Error patterns (e.g., common mistakes)
- Change in accuracy/reaction time over session
- Consistency of response speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect response)
- Biases (e.g., tendency to select certain answers)

### Other Contextual Data
- User’s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Spatial Reasoning Ability
- Visual Perception
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Bias Awareness

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Spatial Reasoning Skill (high vs. low)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Consistency vs. Variability
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Patience vs. Urgency
6. Confidence vs. Hesitation
7. Engagement vs. Distraction
8. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
9. Bias Awareness vs. Unawareness
10. Decision-Making Speed (deliberate vs. impulsive)
