# Trust Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of rounds played
- Total amount sent/received
- Total returns made/received
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Round
- Round index/order in session
- Role (investor/trustee)
- Amount sent (if investor)
- Amount received (if trustee)
- Amount returned (if trustee)
- User’s response (amount sent/returned)
- Time offer made/received
- Time of user response
- Time to respond (reaction time)
- Number of negotiation rounds (if applicable)
- Whether user changed offer/response after initial decision
- Outcome (final payoff)

### Per Action
- Action timestamp
- Amount entered
- Response selected
- Time since previous action
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before action (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Average amount sent/returned
- Standard deviation of amounts
- Change in offers/returns over session
- Consistency of decision speed
- Response to breaches of trust (change in behavior after low/high returns)
- Biases (e.g., tendency to trust/distrust certain partners)

### Other Contextual Data
- User’s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Trust Assessment
- Decision-Making Style
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Trust
- Reciprocity
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to breaches of trust)
- Social Sensitivity

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Bias Awareness

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Trust Propensity (high vs. low)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Consistency vs. Variability
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Patience vs. Urgency
6. Confidence vs. Hesitation
7. Reciprocity vs. Self-Interest
8. Engagement vs. Distraction
9. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
10. Bias Awareness vs. Unawareness
