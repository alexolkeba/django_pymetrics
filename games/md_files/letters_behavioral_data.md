# Letters (N-back) Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of trials
- Total correct responses (targets)
- Total incorrect responses (false alarms, misses)
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Trial
- Trial index/order in session
- Letter presented
- Is target (yes/no)
- User’s response (hit/miss)
- Time letter appeared
- Time of user response
- Reaction time (ms)
- Whether response was correct or incorrect
- Number of anticipatory responses (before stimulus)
- Number of late responses (after allowed window)
- Whether user repeated trial (if allowed)

### Per Response Action
- Response timestamp
- Key/button pressed
- Time since letter appeared
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before response (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Accuracy rate (overall, targets, non-targets)
- Average reaction time (overall, targets, non-targets)
- Error patterns (e.g., false alarms, misses)
- Change in accuracy/reaction time over session
- Consistency of response speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect response)
- Anticipation vs. delay patterns

### Other Contextual Data
- User’s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Working Memory (N-back)
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring
- Impulse Control

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Impulsivity

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Working Memory Capacity (high vs. low)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Consistency vs. Variability
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Patience vs. Urgency
6. Confidence vs. Hesitation
7. Impulse Control vs. Impulsivity
8. Engagement vs. Distraction
9. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
10. Resilience vs. Frustration
