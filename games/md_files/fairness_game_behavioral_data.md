# Fairness Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of rounds played
- Total offers made/received
- Total acceptances/rejections
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Round
- Round index/order in session
- Role (proposer/responder)
- Offer amount (if proposer)
- Offer received (if responder)
- User’s response (accept/reject)
- Time offer made/received
- Time of user response
- Time to respond (reaction time)
- Fairness perception rating (if collected)
- Number of negotiation rounds (if applicable)
- Whether user changed offer/response after initial decision
- Outcome (accepted/rejected, payoff)

### Per Action
- Action timestamp
- Offer amount entered
- Response selected
- Time since previous action
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before action (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Average offer made/accepted
- Standard deviation of offers
- Acceptance/rejection rates
- Change in offers/responses over session
- Consistency of decision speed
- Response to unfair offers (change in behavior after low/high offers)
- Biases (e.g., tendency to accept/reject certain offers)

### Other Contextual Data
- User’s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Fairness Perception
- Decision-Making Style
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Altruism
- Reciprocity
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to unfairness)
- Social Sensitivity

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Bias Awareness

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Fairness Sensitivity (high vs. low)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Consistency vs. Variability
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Patience vs. Urgency
6. Confidence vs. Hesitation
7. Altruism vs. Self-Interest
8. Engagement vs. Distraction
9. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
10. Bias Awareness vs. Unawareness
