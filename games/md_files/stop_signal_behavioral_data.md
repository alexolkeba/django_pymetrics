# Stop Signal Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of go trials
- Total number of stop trials
- Total correct go responses
- Total correct stop responses
- Total errors (commission/omission)
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Trial
- Trial index/order in session
- Trial type (go/stop)
- Stimulus presented
- Time stimulus appeared
- Time of user response
- Reaction time (go trials)
- Stop signal delay (stop trials)
- Whether response was correct, incorrect, or missed
- Type of error (commission, omission, late response)
- Number of anticipatory responses (before stimulus)
- Number of late responses (after allowed window)
- Whether user repeated trial (if allowed)

### Per Response Action
- Response timestamp
- Key/button pressed
- Time since stimulus appeared
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before response (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Average reaction time (go trials)
- Standard deviation of reaction time
- Stop signal reaction time (SSRT)
- Accuracy rate (go and stop trials)
- Change in reaction time/accuracy over session
- Consistency of response speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect/missed response)
- Anticipation vs. delay patterns

### Other Contextual Data
- Userâ€™s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Inhibitory Control
- Processing Speed
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Impulsivity

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Inhibitory Control (strong vs. weak)
2. Processing Speed (fast vs. slow)
3. Attention vs. Distraction
4. Consistency vs. Variability
5. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
6. Patience vs. Urgency
7. Confidence vs. Hesitation
8. Impulse Control vs. Impulsivity
9. Engagement vs. Distraction
10. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
