# Reaction Timer Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of trials
- Total correct responses
- Total incorrect/missed responses
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Trial
- Trial index/order in session
- Stimulus type (visual/auditory, if applicable)
- Time stimulus appeared
- Time of user response
- Reaction time (ms)
- Whether response was correct, incorrect, or missed
- Type of error (false alarm, miss, slow response)
- Number of anticipatory responses (before stimulus)
- Number of late responses (after allowed window)
- Whether user repeated trial (if allowed)

### Per Response Action
- Response timestamp
- Key/button pressed
- Time since stimulus appeared
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before response (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Average reaction time
- Standard deviation of reaction time
- Accuracy rate
- Change in reaction time/accuracy over session
- Consistency of response speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect/missed response)
- Anticipation vs. delay patterns

### Other Contextual Data
- Userâ€™s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Processing Speed
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring
- Impulse Control

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Impulsivity

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Processing Speed (fast vs. slow)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Consistency vs. Variability
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Patience vs. Urgency
6. Confidence vs. Hesitation
7. Impulse Control vs. Impulsivity
8. Engagement vs. Distraction
9. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
10. Resilience vs. Frustration
