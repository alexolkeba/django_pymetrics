# Digit Span Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of trials presented
- Total correct trials
- Total incorrect trials
- Highest span achieved
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Trial
- Trial index/order in session
- Span length (number of digits)
- Sequence of digits presented
- Sequence of digits entered by user
- Trial start timestamp
- Trial end timestamp
- Time to first input
- Time to complete input
- Time per digit entered (list of intervals)
- Whether the trial was forward or backward (if applicable)
- Whether the trial was correct or incorrect
- Number of errors (if any)
- Type of error (omission, transposition, substitution)
- Whether user requested a repeat (if allowed)

### Per Input Action
- Input timestamp
- Digit entered
- Position in sequence
- Time since previous input
- Correction/backspace events
- Input hesitation (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Average span achieved
- Standard deviation of span achieved
- Average time per digit
- Change in performance over session (learning/adaptation)
- Change in response time over session
- Error patterns (e.g., more errors at higher spans)
- Consistency of input speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect trial)

### Other Contextual Data
- Userâ€™s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Working Memory Capacity
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring
- Sequential Processing

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Frustration Tolerance
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Confidence
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Persistence
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Working Memory Capacity (high vs. low)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Persistence vs. Resignation
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Consistency vs. Variability
6. Patience vs. Urgency
7. Confidence vs. Hesitation
8. Emotional Regulation vs. Reactivity
9. Engagement vs. Distraction
10. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
