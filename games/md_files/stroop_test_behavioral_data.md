# Stroop Test Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of trials
- Total correct responses
- Total incorrect responses
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Trial
- Trial index/order in session
- Stimulus type (congruent/incongruent)
- Word presented
- Color presented
- Correct response
- User’s response
- Time stimulus appeared
- Time of user response
- Reaction time
- Whether response was correct or incorrect
- Type of error (e.g., color-word mismatch)
- Number of anticipatory responses (before stimulus)
- Number of late responses (after allowed window)
- Whether user repeated trial (if allowed)

### Per Response Action
- Response timestamp
- Key/button pressed
- Time since stimulus appeared
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before response (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Average reaction time (congruent vs. incongruent)
- Standard deviation of reaction time
- Accuracy rate (congruent vs. incongruent)
- Change in reaction time/accuracy over session
- Consistency of response speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect response)
- Interference effect (difference between congruent and incongruent trials)

### Other Contextual Data
- User’s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Cognitive Control
- Processing Speed
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Error Monitoring

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Impulsivity

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Cognitive Control (strong vs. weak)
2. Processing Speed (fast vs. slow)
3. Attention vs. Distraction
4. Consistency vs. Variability
5. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
6. Patience vs. Urgency
7. Confidence vs. Hesitation
8. Impulse Control vs. Impulsivity
9. Engagement vs. Distraction
10. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
