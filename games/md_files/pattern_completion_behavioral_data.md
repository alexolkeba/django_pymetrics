# Pattern Completion Game: Behavioral Data Points and Trait Inference

## 1. Highly Granular Behavioral Data Points

### Per Session
- Session start and end timestamps
- Total number of patterns presented
- Total correct completions
- Total incorrect completions
- Session duration
- Device/browser info

### Per Pattern/Trial
- Pattern ID
- Pattern type/complexity
- Trial index/order in session
- Time pattern appeared
- Time of user response
- Time to respond (reaction time)
- User’s selected completion
- Whether response was correct or incorrect
- Confidence rating (if collected)
- Number of attempts (if retries allowed)
- Type of error (e.g., specific distractor chosen)
- Whether user skipped or timed out

### Per Response Action
- Response timestamp
- Completion selected
- Time since pattern appeared
- Correction/change of answer (if allowed)
- Hesitation before response (long pauses)

### Behavioral Patterns & Meta-Metrics
- Accuracy rate (overall, per pattern type)
- Average reaction time (overall, per pattern type)
- Error patterns (e.g., common distractors)
- Change in accuracy/reaction time over session
- Consistency of response speed
- Response to errors (change in behavior after incorrect response)
- Biases (e.g., tendency to select certain completions)

### Other Contextual Data
- User’s focus/blur events
- Interruptions or pauses
- Mouse movement or hover data (if feasible)
- Any error or unexpected behavior events

## 2. Inferred Cognitive, Socio-Emotional, and Behavioral Traits

### Cognitive Traits
- Pattern Recognition Ability
- Attention & Focus
- Learning & Adaptivity
- Decision-Making Speed
- Error Monitoring

### Socio-Emotional Traits
- Confidence
- Resilience (response to errors)
- Motivation

### Behavioral Traits
- Consistency
- Adaptability
- Patience
- Bias Awareness

### Meta-Traits (Composite)
- Self-Control
- Stress Response
- Engagement

## 3. Categorization into Broad, Bi-Directional Dimensions

1. Pattern Recognition Accuracy (high vs. low)
2. Attention vs. Distraction
3. Consistency vs. Variability
4. Adaptability vs. Rigidity
5. Patience vs. Urgency
6. Confidence vs. Hesitation
7. Engagement vs. Distraction
8. Error Monitoring vs. Carelessness
9. Bias Awareness vs. Unawareness
10. Decision-Making Speed (deliberate vs. impulsive)
