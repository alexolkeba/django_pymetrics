# Professional Context Engineering for Django Pymetrics

## Project Awareness & Context
- Modular Django apps: `accounts` (user management), `ai_model` (trait profiles), `games` (game sessions/results), `pymetric` (core settings), and `django_backend/static/emotional_faces` (game assets).
- Models for users (`User`, `RecruiterProfile`, `CandidateProfile`), game sessions/results (`GameSession`, `GameResult`), and trait profiles (`TraitProfile`).
- Designed for neuroscience-based behavioral data collection, granular event logging, and psychometric trait inference, aligned with Pymetrics standards.

## Data Collection & Event Logging
- Implement robust event logging for all user interactions in each game (e.g., Balloon Risk, Memory Cards, Reaction Timer, etc.).
- Use Django models to capture session, trial, action, and meta-events, ensuring all relevant fields are present (see `games/models.py` and `ai_model/models.py`).
- Store raw behavioral data in JSON fields for flexibility and future-proofing.

## Metric Extraction & Trait Inference
- After each session, aggregate raw events into summary metrics (per session, per game, per action).
- Map these metrics to bi-directional trait dimensions (risk tolerance, working memory, attention control, etc.) using documented logic in `ai_model/models.py` and game-specific schemas.
- Document the transformation logic for scientific reproducibility and auditability.

## API & Frontend Integration
- Provide REST API endpoints for event ingestion, retrieval, and trait profile access.
- Ensure frontend games send granular event data to the backend in real time (AJAX/WebSocket).
- Batch events for performance, but preserve granularity and context.

## Testing & Reliability
- Create unit tests for models, API endpoints, and metric extraction logic.
- Simulate sessions to validate data capture and trait inference.
- Use a `/tests` folder mirroring the main app structure.

## Privacy & Ethics
- Anonymize/pseudonymize user data where possible.
- Comply with data protection regulations and ethical standards.
- Ensure all behavioral data handling is scientifically valid and reproducible.

## Documentation
- Maintain clear documentation for event schemas, metric extraction, and trait mapping.
- Version all schema and transformation logic for reproducibility.
- Document how raw events are transformed into summary metrics and trait profiles.

## Best Practices
- Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Never create a file longer than 500 lines; refactor as needed.
- Use clear, consistent imports and environment variable management.
- Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md` immediately after finishing them.
- Reference official Django and DRF documentation, as well as your own research files.

## Implementation Guidance
- Review and refactor existing models in `accounts/models.py`, `ai_model/models.py`, and `games/models.py` to ensure all necessary fields and relationships are present for behavioral analytics.
- Expand event logging to cover all granular behavioral data points for each game.
- Implement metric extraction and trait inference logic as modular, testable Django/Celery tasks.
- Build REST APIs for all core data flows and ensure frontend integration for real-time event capture.
- Document every schema, transformation, and trait mapping for future developers and scientific validation.

This context engineering guide is designed to enable AI coding assistants and developers to update, extend, and implement all necessary features for a fully functional Django Pymetrics application, ensuring one-pass implementation success and alignment with the highest standards of behavioral data science.

### üåÄ Project Awareness & Context & Research
- Always read `Pymetrics Application Research.md` at the start of a new conversation to understand the scientific, architectural, and ethical foundations of the Django Pymetrics project.
- Check `TASK.md` before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns as described in this context engineering template.
- Use Django ORM for all models and Django REST Framework for APIs.
- Use Docker for local development and testing if possible.
- Stick to OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION PAGES ONLY for Django, DRF, and scientific references.
- Refer to the `/research/` directory and `games/md_files/` for behavioral data schemas and trait mappings before implementing any feature.
- Always version event schemas and metric extraction logic for scientific reproducibility.

### üß© Code Structure & Modularity
- Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code. Refactor by splitting into modules or helper files.
- Organize code into clearly separated Django apps and modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Use clear, consistent imports and environment variable management.
- Use pytest for unit tests and scientific documentation standards.
- All behavioral event logging and trait inference logic must be modular and well-documented.

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- Always create Pytest unit tests for new features (models, APIs, metric extraction, trait inference).
- Simulate sessions to validate data capture and trait inference.
- Tests should live in a `/tests` folder mirroring the main app structure.
- Include at least: 1 test for expected use, 1 edge case, 1 failure case.

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md` immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.

### üè∑Ô∏è Style & Conventions
- Use Python as the primary language.
- Follow PEP8, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- Use Django ORM for data validation and DRF for APIs.
- Write docstrings for every function using the Google style.

### üìö Documentation & Explainability
- Update `README.md` when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- Comment non-obvious code and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, add an inline `# Reason:` comment explaining the why, not just the what.
- Document all event schemas, metric extraction, and trait mapping logic for scientific reproducibility.

### ü§ñ AI Behavior Rules
- Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.
- Never hallucinate libraries or functions ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- Always confirm file paths and module names exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- Never delete or overwrite existing code unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.

### üîí Privacy & Ethics
- Anonymize/pseudonymize user data where possible.
- Comply with data protection regulations and ethical standards.
- Ensure all behavioral data handling is scientifically valid and reproducible.

### üé® Design
- Stick to the design system inside designsystem.md for building any new features and game UIs.
