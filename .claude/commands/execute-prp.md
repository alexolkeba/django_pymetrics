# Professional Context Engineering for Django Pymetrics

This command executes a feature implementation using a PRP file, following context engineering best practices for one-pass implementation success.

## Execution Process
1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Extend research if needed
   - Ensure all needed context is present
   - Perform additional web/codebase searches as needed

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code

3. **Execute the Plan**
   - Implement all code as specified in the PRP

4. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures and re-run until all pass

5. **Complete**
   - Ensure all checklist items are done
   - Run final validation suite
   - Report completion status
   - Re-read the PRP to ensure full implementation

6. **Reference the PRP**
   - Reference the PRP again if needed during implementation

## Notes
- If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry
- Always follow context engineering principles for robust, scalable, and scientifically valid code
