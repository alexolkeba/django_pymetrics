## ðŸ”§ **IMPROVEMENT APPLIED**

### **Button Consolidation**

- **Result**: Cleaner, more intuitive user interface with single action button
- **Status**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

### **Improvement Details:**
- **Before**: Two separate buttons - "Back to Games" (link) and "End Session" (button)
- **After**: Single "Back to Games" button that:
  - Ends the current session if game is active
  - Saves game data and logs session end event
  - Redirects to games list page
  - Provides immediate feedback to user

## ðŸ”„ **FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES**

### **Enhanced "Back to Games" Button Behavior:**

#### **During Active Game:**
1. **Logs session end event** with current score/progress
2. **Disables game controls** to prevent further interaction
3. **Shows session ended message** with final score
4. **Saves game data** to backend
5. **Redirects to games list** after data is saved

#### **After Game Completion:**
1. **Directly redirects** to games list (no session ending needed)
2. **Clean navigation** without redundant actions

### **Code Pattern Applied:**
```javascript
document.getElementById('back-to-games').onclick = function() {
    // If game is still active, end session first
    if (currentRound <= TOTAL_ROUNDS) {
        logEvent('manual_end', {final_score: score});
        // Disable game controls
        document.querySelectorAll('.game-btn').forEach(btn => btn.disabled = true);
        document.getElementById('game-area').innerHTML = 
            `<div class='font-bold text-lg text-red-600'>Session Ended! Final score: ${score}</div>`;
        sendEventsToBackend();
    }
    // Redirect to games list
    window.location.href = '/games/';
};
```
